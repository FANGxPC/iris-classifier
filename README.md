***Iris Classification with Machine Learning***
Simple project to load the Iris dataset, try multiple classic ML models, and compare their accuracy using cross-validation.

Loads Iris data and splits into training/validation sets

Trains six popular classifiers (Logistic Regression, LDA, KNN, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, SVM)

Uses stratified 10-fold cross-validation to evaluate models

Trains final SVM model and shows accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

Visualizes SVM decision boundaries on pairs of features for insight

**Setup**
Install required packages:

bash
pip install pandas matplotlib scikit-learn mlxtend
How to run
Simply run the script. It prints model comparisons and shows plots for decision boundaries.

**About**
Great for learning ML basics: data prep, model evaluation, and visualization in Python.
